# DataExplorationCovid-19

Through this project I tried to find meaningful insights and explore the situation of COVID-19 around the globe.

The data-set can be found at [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths). 
And then I have manipulated the data to create two tables out of single data-set. The two EXCEL file can be found in [data](/data/) folder of this repository.

This EXCEL File can be easily imported to the SQL server using the import data functionality of SQL.
